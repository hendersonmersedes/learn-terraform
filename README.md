# learn-terraform
This is the process that I started when learning <b>Terraform</b>.
<p>Terraform is the infrastructure as code tool used to manage things such as servers, networking and storage.</p>
<p>I am going to be using a Windows machine throughout this process but it is still great from Mac</p>
<p> The first step was to download Terraform onto my system using the instructions from the Hashicorp website</p>
<p>This link(https://www.terraform.io/downloads) takes you directly to the site and from there you can easily follow the steps for downloading Terraform</p>
Note: PowerShell and VS Code are also good tools to have downloaded as well.
